# AI-Powered Resume Screener 🤖

### Overview
A Python-based tool designed to automate the initial stage of recruitment. It uses **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **Cosine Similarity** to match candidate resumes against specific job descriptions.

### Features
- **PDF Parsing:** Extracts text directly from professional resumes using `PyPDF2`.
- **Match Analytics:** Uses `scikit-learn` to calculate a percentage match score based on keyword density and context.
- **Error Handling:** Robust `try-except` blocks to handle missing files or parsing errors.

### Why I built this
I built this project to demonstrate my understanding of the tech stack used by **Hello Recruiter™**. It reflects my interest in how AI can streamline conversational interviews and candidate screening.
